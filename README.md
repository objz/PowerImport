# PowerImport

**PowerImport** is a tiny utility add-in for Excel that lets you import tables directly from Power BI Desktop into your Excel sheets—no hassle, no complex setup.

---

## Why?

Because Microsoft didn’t bother to make this easy.
I made this project in about 3 hours at work, just to get around their (let’s be honest) lazy integration.

---

## What does it do?

* Lists tables from your open Power BI Desktop instance(s)
* Lets you select and import any table into Excel—right where you need it
* No crazy setup or Power Query dance

---

## Who’s it for?

Anyone who just wants to grab data from Power BI into Excel—fast.

---

## How to use

1. Install the MSI add-in see https://github.com/objz/PowerImport/releases/tag/1.0.0 
2. Open Excel, look for the “PowerImport” tab.
3. Click "Import Queries", pick your table, and import. That’s it.

**Have fun, and enjoy doing Microsoft’s job for them!**
